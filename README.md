# Sperm-morphology-classifer  
  

### About:   
This repository contains the source code for Spermatozoa Classifier that detects sperm morphology defects.
  
## Problem Boundary
Subfertility or infertility affects many couples globally and is considered a public health issue (Awtani et al., 2017). Male infertility can be explained as human male’s inability to cause pregnancy in a fertile female (Shaker et al., 2017). Previous research that is conducted in the field of reproductive health care shows that approximately 7% of all men are infertile globally. (Ghasemian, et al., 2015). Analysis of semen samples are carried out in andrology laboratories to identify the male partners fertile potential. Spermatozoa concentration, motility, vitality, morphology, the analysis of macroscopic and microscopic data (Cao et al., 2011). Semen specimens are evaluated according to terms of macroscopic (appearance, viscosity, Liquefaction, volume and pH) and microscopic (concentration, motility, vitality, morphology and DNA fragmentation) data of the semen samples (Cao et al., 2011). Microscopic evaluation of sperm morphology is very time consuming and needs well trained personnel. To manage the time loss there are several imported computer systems that can help identify sperm morphology but most of the machine learning algorithms are trained by data from European and American patients. Due to the above constraints inside of sub-continent countries the existing systems will generate low accuracy output.
